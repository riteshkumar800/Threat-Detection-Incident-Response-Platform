rule.py

Pydantic schemas for correlation rule endpoints

Defines condition schemas for each rule type (threshold, sequence,
aggregation) and validates the conditions dict in RuleCreateRequest
against the correct schema based on rule_type, catching structural
errors before a rule reaches the engine.

Key exports:
  RuleCreateRequest - creation schema with conditions validation
  RuleUpdateRequest - partial update schema
  RuleTestRequest - hours window for dry-run evaluation
  ThresholdConditions, SequenceConditions, AggregationConditions

Connects to:
  models/CorrelationRule.py - imports RuleType
  models/LogEvent.py - imports Severity
  config.py - reads TIMELINE_DEFAULT_HOURS, RULE_TEST_MAX_HOURS
  routes/rules.py - passed to S()
